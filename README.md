# Assembly_Avg_Calculator
Average calculator written in assembly code for a Commodore 64

This project was done during the COMP 228 course at Concordia University during the Summer 2021 semester. 

To run this file, you'll need to first assemble it using tools you can download online. We used this one https://github.com/cc65/cc65 . 
To emulate a Commodore 64, we used this https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/index.html#download . 

The program takes 8 two-digit positive number, computes the average and then displays it on the screen.

This was done by Frédéric Pelletier, Terrance Liang, Ibrahim Elyyan, Farnaz Zaveh.
